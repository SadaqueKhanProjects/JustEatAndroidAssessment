## üìä Assumptions, Considerations & Solutions

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Restaurant Name

**Assumptions & Challenges:**
- Some restaurant names from the API included **non-essential or noisy tokens** such as:
  - Trailing dashes: `‚ÄúBento Box -‚Äù`
  - Embedded address fragments: `‚ÄúSushi Daily - London Bridge‚Äù`
  - Social media handles or branding noise

**Implemented Solution:**
- Applied **light name sanitization** using string processing to trim:
  - Trailing `-` and brackets
  - Obvious non-name fragments

**Considered but Not Implemented:**
- A **blacklist-based rule engine** was avoided due to **lack of full dataset access**.

**If Full Data Was Available:**
- Frequency-based detection could classify ‚Äújunk‚Äù tokens.
- Normalize and group variants of restaurant brands.

---

### ‚≠ê Rating / Stars

**Assumptions & Challenges:**
- API returns a `starRating` float inside a `rating` object reliably.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Used directly with **no transformations or assumptions**.

---

### üçΩÔ∏è Cuisine Type

**Assumptions & Challenges:**
- Inconsistent or ambiguous cuisine values from the API.

**Implemented Solution:**
- **Whitelist-based filtering** applied using well-known cuisines (e.g., ‚ÄúPizza‚Äù, ‚ÄúHalal‚Äù, ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù).

**Why Whitelist:**
- Finite number of logical cuisines.
- Executing all postcodes to gather more data was **not feasible** due to time limits and API restrictions.

**Attempted Data Expansion:**
- Tried querying alternative endpoints for metadata or broader results.
- Received `403 Forbidden` ‚Äî likely due to public API protection and authentication barriers.

**Ideal Future Approach:**
- Use full metadata or schema to dynamically validate and group cuisines.

---

### üß≠ Address (UK Format)

**Status:**
- Address data (`firstLine`, `city`, `postalCode`) was **clean and properly structured**.
- No special sanitization required beyond spacing adjustments.

---

## Device Compatibility & Visual Feedback

- Tested on:
  - **Pixel 6 Emulator (API 34)**
  - **Samsung S22 Ultra (API 14)**
- Differences in UI appearance (e.g. spacing, font size) are expected due to:
  - Varying screen densities
  - System font scaling
  - OEM-level theming

---

## üîß Suggested Improvements

- **Consistent UI Across Devices**  
  Some UI components (like the search bar and error messages) may appear differently depending on screen size, resolution, or font scaling settings. Using a more standardized spacing and typography system via `MaterialTheme` ensures a **consistent and polished experience**, no matter what phone the user is on.

- **More Intuitive Error Feedback**  
  Presenting error messages via **dialogs or snackbars**‚Äîinstead of inline text‚Äîmirrors how most apps provide feedback. This instantly communicates that ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù in a way that‚Äôs **familiar, unobtrusive, and human-centric**, reducing the chance users miss important messages.

- **UI Confidence Across Devices**  
  The app was tested on:
  - Pixel 6 Emulator (API 34)
  - Samsung S22 Ultra (API 14)

  To ensure a more universal experience, further testing on modern devices with varied screen densities would help catch any unexpected layout shifts or usability issues.
